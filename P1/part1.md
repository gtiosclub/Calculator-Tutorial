## Part 1: Creating your Xcode Project

This tutorial will teach you how to build a Calculator app using Interface Builder and Storyboards. To get started, open up Xcode. You should see a screen that looks like this:

Click **Create a new Xcode Project** and select the iOS Single View Application template. 
(If you don't see the welcome screen, `Command-Shift-N` will get the job done.)

- **AppDelegate.swift**: Communication point between iOS and your app.
- **ViewController.swift**: A View Controller is a single screen on an iPhone app. It controls the content on-screen and handles user interaction.
- **Main.storyboard**: Contains the layout of your app. We'll open this in a sec.
- **Assets.xcassets**: Contains images that yor app uses, including the icon.
- **LaunchScreen.storyboard**: A static storyboard that opens while your app is launching.
- **Info.plist**: Configures some properties of your app.

### Recap
